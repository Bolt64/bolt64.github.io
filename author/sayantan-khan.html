<p>Chances are, if you are here, you are, one, either a student about to join
IISc, or less likely but plausible, a parent of a one such person. And you're
here specifically because you had some question(s) that you believe already has
been asked, and your seniors, slightly annoyed, had spammed your post with
requests asking you to refer to the first post (cough**a certain junior**cough).
TL;DR: This is a list of frequently asked questions, and you're here because
you had a question.</p>
<h3>My question's not on this list. What do I do?</h3>
<p>First of all. Congratulations! You managed to ask a question that no one has
asked before. That, as you'll learn soon enough, is the first step towards a
Nobel Prize (on the other hand, for a Fields Medal, you just have to be a
frickin' genius). There are three things you can do now. You could either email
me (bolt.khan AT gmail DOT com), ask this question on the facebook group, or both.
(I'd recommend you do the third, so I get to know that I need to put up a
question). I'm not very good at facebooking (is that a valid verb?), so the
email would notify me I need to update the site.</p>
<h3>You didn't opt for biology in 11th and 12th? Could that pose problems for you in your first and second sememster?</h3>
<p>Short answer: No.</p>
<p>Slightly longer answer: Chillax, you'll be fine.</p>
<p>A little longer: The first half of the first sem is just ecology, and the kind
of stuff we do is something that even the bio-enthusiasts didn't do in school. The
second half is molecular biology, so the bio-enthusiasts have a marginal edge, but
you can even that out by a spending a couple of evenings at the library. As for
the second sem, the things you'll be doing will be advanced enough for it to be
as much effort for the bio-enthusiasts as it will be for you. So to answer a slightly
different question, do the bio-enthusiasts have any edge over you, the answer, is no,
none at all.</p>
<h3>What about the programming course in the first semester? I've heard horror stories about it. Should I be worried?</h3>
<p>Depends on the story you've heard. If the story involves crazy fictional
monsters like werewolves and the like, they're probably nonsense. On the other
hand, if the story involved vampires, it has an element of truth in it. We do
have a reverse vampire in our class after all.</p>
<p>But all jokes aside, maybe you should put in a bit of effort into learning C
before you come here. It can't hurt, that's for sure. And put in some effort
into actual programming, not just reading a book, because debugging code is
hands down the most useful survival tool for the first sem. The theoretical
part shouldn't be too hard, it's just applied math. But, I iterate again, learn
how to debug your own code.</p>
<h3>This site looks plain and dull? What's wrong? Is the site meant to be this way or does my browser suck?</h3>
<p>The site is meant to be simple. I can't do fancy CSS and colours when I'm using
a mobile phone. But yeah, unless you're using firefox, your browser probably
sucks.</p>                </article>
